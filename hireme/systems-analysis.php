            <p>In the summer of 2018, I took the capstone class for my computer
              science degree: systems analysis and design. This course provides
              a general understanding of how to conduct the work of a systems
              analyst in terms of doing requirements analysis, working with stakeholders,
              putting together an effective design, conducting business analytics,
              and managing the overall process end-to-end.</p>
            <p>I had previously or concurrently taken classes in several programming
              languages and learned some things about network and hardware. This was
              useful because it gave me the ability to synthesize all those skills
              and see how the bigger picture fit together.</p>

              of the assignments I did for this class.</a> It contains a mock project
              scope statement for the creation of a website for a nonprofit, as well as
              the breakeven analysis for that project.</p>
