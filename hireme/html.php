	        		<p>I programmed the website for Ellis Wyatt, a roofing company, using
                HTML and CSS. I worked with the owners of Ellis Wyatt Roofing to
                create their website. It helps them to market to potential clients
                and showcase their previous projects.</p>
        		</div>
              <h3>Speset website</h3>
        			<p>I also used HTML and CSS to create the website for Speset, a company that
                provides resources to both traditionally-schooled and homeschooled kids.
                Since I created this website, the mailing list I integrated into it has gained
                over a hundred subscribers, with no additional marketing.</p>

          		<h2>How I did it:</h2>
              <a href="http://speset.com/"><img src="speset layout.png" alt="Speset website"></a>
          		<p>I learned web design with a combination of community college classes from CCAC
              and online resources. I started playing around with web design about six years
              ago, mainly just teaching myself things with online tutorials and trial and error.
              The turning-point, though, where I went from amateur web programming enthusiast to
              an entry-level professional, happened with one particular book: "HTML, CSS,
              and JavaScript Web Publishing" by Colburn, Kyrnin, and Lemay. It was the
              step-by-step tutorial that I never knew I needed, and it taught me the correct
              ways to do all sorts of things that I'd been using vague, hackneyed solutions
              for before.</p>
