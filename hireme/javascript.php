        		<h1>JavaScript</h1>

        		<h2>What I did:</h2>
        		<h3>Drop-down menu</h3>
        		<p>When I created this website, I knew I wanted to make it adaptable. From a common sense
        		standpoint, it doesn't make sense for a website to only look decent on one size of screen when
        		there are so many out there. But given how my nav bar works, resizing it turned it into two
        		rows. I had a bit of a technical dilemma: I could write two hundred different use cases for
        		where to put the little divider things so that they lined up evenly with the browser window
        		size... or I could just code a drop-down. Understandably, I did the latter, which resulted in
        		what I've got now.</p>
        		<p>When the user hovers over the "Menu" button, it changes color, and when the user clicks on
        		it, a drop-down menu of links appears. If the user clicks a link, they are redirected; if
        		they click outside the menu, it closes. (If you're on desktop, just make your browser window
        		smaller to see for yourself!)</p>

        		<h3>Simple art program</h3>
        		<p>Over a year ago, I took the AP Computer Science Principles exam. This exam is graded half on
        		a multiple choice test, and half on two projects. I chose to do my project in JavaScript, and I
        		chose to create an art program.</p>
        		<p>The user can select one of the buttons at the top to create a certain type of shape. The
        		user can create shapes of different sizes and placements by clicking and dragging.</p>


        		<h2>How I did it:</h2>
        		<p>I learned a lot of JavaScript from using it to create my final project for APCSP. By using
        		it essentially as its own stand-alone language, I learned about the power of JavaScript as a
        		language - something I don't think I would have really grasped if I started out using it only
        		to animate parts of web pages. However, I learned essentially nothing about how to integrate
        		JavaScript with web pages until I read "HTML, CSS, & JavaScript Web Publishing" by Colburn,
        		Kyrnin, and Lemay. Once I read that book, I learned how to use onclick, onhover, etc. to
        		make interactive web pages.</p>
