    		<p>Hey there! If you’re looking to hire an entry-level techie, this is the place to be. 
    		Here, you’ll find examples of my skills and credentials, plus my resume and portfolio.</p>
    		<p>A great place to start would be my Resume, where you’ll find the web version of 
    		my resume, plus a PDF download.</p>
    		<p>You can also check out the Skills page, where you’ll see a detailed list of all languages 
    		I’m proficient in, projects and coursework I’ve completed, and certifications I’ve earned, 
    		plus examples of my work.</p>
    		<p>Finally, my portfolio project page contains a detailed documentation of a coding project I did 
    		over the month of September in 2018. Spoiler alert: I got the whole thing done despite having 
    		untreated pneumonia for a week!</p>
