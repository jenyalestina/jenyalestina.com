        		<p>Last year, I needed to do a project for my AP Java class, and I knew that my 
        		mother's business, Ellis Wyatt, currently had an inefficient and manual system of 
        		generating quotes for clients. After discussion with the relevant salespeople, I 
        		developed a specification for a quote generation application which would be very 
        		helpful to the business.</p>
        		<p>The above is a video demonstrating the functionality of the first version of the 
        		app. In it, there are three screens: the main screen, which contains two 
        		buttons, New Quote and Show Quotes; the Create New Quote screen, which lets the user 
        		input quote information including job site details, client details, and pricing; and 
        		the Show Existing Quotes screen, which shows all existing quotes organized in descending 
        		order by quote number.</p>
        		<p>(Please excuse my desktop background. I'm a logic nerd.)</p>

        		<h2>How I did it:</h2>
        		<p>I learned Java in two primary ways. My general introduction to the language came 
        		from courses taken at CCAC and online through Edhesive. After these courses, I 
        		took the AP Java, for which I had to create an application. In order to create the 
        		app I eventually did, I had to learn a lot about GUI-related classes, which my 
        		coursework hadn't even touched on. As such, I did a lot of independent self-study on 
        		those topics. This was my second method of learning Java, and it became my primary 
        		one after I finished learning the basics.</p>
