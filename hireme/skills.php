              <h2>Data Science and Machine Learning</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>I do machine learning and data science using Python and its various data science
                and machine learning related libraries, including TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy,
                SciPy, SciKitLearn, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, and StatsModels.</p>
              <p>I learned data science for a professional development project (PDP) before I began
                my Praxis apprenticeship, and I wrote weekly blogs over the course
                of learning these skills. Here are the blog posts:<br>

              <p>Unfortunately, before I could finish this project (which was supposed to be six weeks long), I
                <a href="http://www.jenyalestina.com/blog/2019/03/19/where-did-i-disappear-to-week-1-at-upgrow-inc/">moved across the country</a>. Fortunately, of late I've been improving greatly at my
                day job, so I'll be picking ML back up again, and I will have a few projects showing
                up in this section shortly.</p>
