            <p>Every year as part of being a homeschooled high school student,
              I've had to put together a "homeschooling portfolio". Basically,
              this portfolio is one of many signals which are designed to tell
              the government that I haven't been slacking off just because I don't
              happen to go to a public school. This portfolio comes in the form
              of a short pamphlet-style document, around 10-15 pages in length
              but mostly comprised of images, which gets wire-bound with nice
              clear laminate covers. It contains detailed information on what
              classes I took, what books I read in what languages, and what
              I decided to do with my free time, including trips, vacations, and
              the like.</p>
            <p>Every year of high school, I helped progressively more with the
              process of creating my portfolio. This most recent year (2018),
              I completed my entire porfolio myself, start-to-finish, and also
              assisted my siblings significantly with theirs. This required a
              working knowledge of images and frames, the process of creating an
              aesthetically pleasing page layout, flowing text around images,
              and other basic InDesign skills.</p>
