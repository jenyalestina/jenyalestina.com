        		<h2>Art</h2>
        		<p>I've been a professional artist for around eight years now. If you would like to commission 
        		me for art, you've come to the right place! For an Official Quote™, 
        		<a href="contact.php">please email me</a>, but here's a short list of some of the things 
        		I can do, along with price ranges.</p>
        		</div>
        		
        		<h3>Landscapes:</h3>
        		<p>
	        		<ul>
	        			<li>Oil paintings on canvas: $70-300 depending on canvas size</li>
	        			<li>Marker drawings on paper: $40-70 depending on paper size and level of detail</li>
	        		</ul>
        		</p>
        		<div>
        			<img src="IMG_1211.jpg" alt="A painting of a scene from the video game World of Warcraft." 
	        		class="commission">
        		<h3>People:</h3>
	        		<p>
	        		I'm capable of a number of different styles of drawing people and humanoids. Here are 
	        		examples of a handful of the styles I've used before:
	        		</p>
        		</div>
	        		<ul>
	        			<li>Various anime styles (Sword Art Online, One Piece, Yuri On Ice, etc.)</li>
	        			<li>Various semi-realistic styles (D&D manual, World of Warcraft, etc.)</li>
	        			<li>Various cartoon or video game styles (Pokemon, etc.)</li>
	        		</ul>
	        		<p>Here are my general pricing guidelines:
	        		<ul>
	        			<li>One character, with or without a background: $40</li>
					<li>Add $15 for a complex background (high level of detail)</li>
					<li>Add $10 for each additional character</li>
	        		</ul>
	        		</p>
	        	<div>
        			<img src="IMG_1214.jpg" alt="A drawing in markers of two women riding a motorcycle." 
        			class="commission">
	        		<p>
	        		Pricing for oil paintings varies by the size of canvas. For more detail, see the PDF I linked 
	        		at the bottom of this page, which contains detailed pricing info and lots of examples!
	        		</p>
	        	</div>
        		<h2>Writing</h2>
	        		<p>I price writing commissions by the word. I can write fiction or nonfiction. 1¢ per word; 
	        		$5 minimum. Any commission under 500 words is still $5.</p>
        		<p>For more detailed information about my commissions and pricing,
